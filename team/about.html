                    <h1>MTRL</h1>
                    <p>MTRL is a Romanian Dota 2 team. It was founded mid-2013 by Razvan Damachi (Discopriest) for the purpose of gathering friends to play casual, amateur Dota 2 together.</p>
                    <p>The team's name and culture  - "materials" in Romanian - were inspired by one of Discopriest's high school friends, Lazer, a Civil Engineering student whose beliefs revolve around construction materials.</p>
                    <p>The second member and first captain of the team was EMUX. Captain Sua and Fega Malus quickly followed. Assuming team positions from 2 to 5, MTRL needed a carry. After research and pondering, Discopriest co-opted DjaDjaw to fill the slot.</p>

                    <h1>The joinDOTA League</h1>
                    <p>The first competition MTRL took part in was the first season of the European joinDOTA League. Newly registered, the team began their journey in the 5th Romanian Starter Division group, among 8 other Romanian teams. MTRL's groupstage performance was outstanding, finishing first place with a brutal score of 16-0.</p>
                    <p>Following their result, EMUX and his crew went on to face the Danish team Furys Dark Seer in the play-offs deciding the 2 to 4 divisions for the next season. MTRL lost the best-of-1 confruntation and signed up for a spot in the 4th jdL Europe division.</p>
                    <p>Game highlights can be found in the video archive.</p>
