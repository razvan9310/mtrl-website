                    <p>Discopriest is the 5th support and founder of MTRL. Although he is the most recent Dota player in the team (playing since November 2012), his skill and dedication helped him adapt to a large variety of heroes in the pool, ranging from hard-supports to carries. His prowess and calculation have made him a versatile player who can fit into all sorts of strategies, from single-core late-game setups to deathball line-ups.</p>

                    </ul>         
                    <p>EMUX is the captain and 4th support of MTRL as well as the team's most experienced player. He has been playing Dota since as far back as 2006. His experience allows him to basically fit any role, understand every strategy and come up with the best draft for every game. Rarely are his decisions contested by any of the players, if ever. He knows every item and build in the game and can adapt to every different lineup and situation.</p>

                    </ul>     
                    <p>Calm and relaxed, Cap. will always enjoy the game without getting even close to angry. He enjoys the offlane role as he finds it to be a great way to help the team. A true soldier and a fair player, Sua will congratulate every enemy, regardless of the game's outcome and will never yell at a teammate, but will always look forward to helping his friends play better. Way to go, Cap!</p>

                    </ul>                    
                    <p>Quite the experienced player himself, Malus' motto is "pick a good hero, play badly, win the game". Many a time has he proven that his skills and decision making are never to be disconsidered. He enjoys playing control-based heroes who can dictate the course of fights towards the team's victory. His versatility allows him to fill other roles too, solo offlane being his second all-time favourite.</p>

                    <p>The one and only MTRL carry, DjaDjaw plays Luna like no one else. He also likes experimenting with more exotic heroes, his quick learning abilities always enlarging the team's hero pool. DjaDjaw is your ideal carry: he's obedient to the team's designated rules and can farm efficiently, while being a party monster in front of his keyboard at home.</p>
