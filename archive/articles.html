                <h1>The Captain's Orders</h1>
                <h6>An interview with Captain Sua</h6>
                <h6>23rd April 2014</h6>
                
                <p>Here's the Cap's interview with the official MTRL reporter:</p>
                <p class="question">Reporter: "Hello, Captain! I'm thrilled to have you here! How was your holiday?"</p>
                <p>Cap: "Thank you for asking, it was a fun holiday, but a bit too short."</p>              
                <p class="question">Reporter: "Yeah, they always are. What have you been up to lately?"</p>
                <p>Cap: "Hitting the gym."</p>
                <p class="question">Reporter: "The team needs a ripped Captain Sua! How do you feel about MTRL's loss against Furys Dark Seer, in the jDL play-offs?"</p>
                <p>Cap: "They were more experienced than us and we knew from the beginning it would be a hard matchup. If we ever meet them again though, we will be better prepared."</p>
                <p class="question">Reporter: "What are your thoughts concerning the second jDL season? How do you imagine the team will perform?"</p>
                <p>Cap: "We will pick Luna every game and win."</p>
                <p class="question">Reporter: "Works every time, doesn't it. But have you guys set any objectives for this season?"</p>
                <p>Cap: "Of course, our main objective is to win all the games we play, but at the very least we want to advance to a higher division."</p>
                <p class="question">Reporter: "Do you fancy joining other competitions in the near future?"</p>
                <p>Cap: "I think we really should be looking to join some other competitions this summer. Right now we don't have too much time for Dota, so the jDL will be enough."</p>
                <p class="question">Reporter: "How do you feel about playing the offlane role? Do you enjoy it? Any other roles you've been experimenting or would like to?"</p>
                <p>Cap: "Playing offlane is fun, because most offlane heroes have interesting abilities that make them both fun and very useful in helping your team in fights. I sometimes play support and I would also like to try out some mid heroes, such as Invoker or Puck."</p>
                <p class="question">Reporter: "Are you attending Dreamhack Bucharest? What are your expectations from this event?"</p>
                <p>Cap: "Yes, I am attending, as I have to sign autographs for our adoring fans. I expect Na'Vi to be victorious in the main event."</p>
                <p class="question">Reporter: "Did you like the Cpt. America sequel?"</p>
                <p>Cap: "It's Cpt. SUA, and yes, I enjoyed the movie, especially the part where SUA took down an enemy aircraft using only his Disk."</p>
                <p class="question">Reporter: "You mean his shield?"</p>
                <p>Cap: "I mean his Disk."</p>
                <p class="question">Reporter: "Alright, Cap. Any other words for the fans?"</p>
                <p>Cap: "Hail Hydra!"</p>
